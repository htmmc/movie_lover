# RUBY exercise using imdb API
This is a week 2 exercise at Ironhack.
I used imdb API to show a poster of a searched movie in one page.

##Features 
- User can search a poster of a movie by entering a keyword.
- A list of posters related to the keyword will appear. 
- User can click the poster to see the year the movie was made.
